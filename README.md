The zero-sum game is a fascinating and challenging sub-area of artificial intelligence and the combinatorial game theory. In order to investigate the performance, feasibility and effectiveness of different AI algorithms and techniques in detail, this project focus on applying multiple customised AI strategies, and combining approaches and ideas from existing literature and resources to a specific strategy board game -- **Gomoku**, which is a typical and well-known zero-sum game. 
Nevertheless, the main goal of the project is not building a powerful Gomoku AI agent, but is investigating and comparing the efficiency and effectiveness of different AI approaches.

The program looks like this:
